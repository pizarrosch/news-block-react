      <p>A pride of lions who lost their enclosure due to damage caused by Storm Eunice are set to return to Africa
        Alive this weekend.
        The lions had been rehomed at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Dunstable since February, but will return with a 'welcome
        home' party at their new and improved enclosure at the Kessingland zoo.</p>

      <p>While the lions have been away, work has taken place to repair the damaged fencing but also make improvements
        to the landscape of the enclosure for the lions – including adding a bark pit,
        two new raised platforms which were made by the keepers and a secondary holding yard to facilitate outdoor
        access for the lions in adverse weather.</p>

      <p>A Yorkshire terrier has had his leg amputated after being bitten by a venomous snake in the Scottish
        countryside.</p>

      <p>Eight-year-old Junior was attacked by an adder while on a walk in Perthshire with owner Lucy Gordon and her two
        other dogs.</p>

      <p>Junior is in a critical condition after being taken to the Edinburgh Veterinary School to have an anti-venom
        administered.</p>

      <p>The tiny dog faces a fight to recover.</p>

      <p>Lucy, 23, told BBC Scotland that Junior had been moved to their own vet in Aberdeen where the amputation took
        place.</p>

      <p>She said: <q>"The tissue damage was beyond repair. The operation was successful and Junior is now a member of
        the three-legged-dogs club.

        "They had to remove more of the leg than we expected but he would have been unbalanced otherwise.

        "He had a comfortable evening but they are still concerned about him, as he hasn't eaten for days. He has been
        put back on to the feeding tube and the glucose drip but he needs to eat to mend."</q></p>

      <p>Police believe 55 sheep have been stolen from crofters' land on Lewis in the Western Isles.</p>

      <p>The theft involves 32 ewes and 23 unborn lambs from Laxay common grazing, an area shared by crofters for
        raising livestock.</p>

      <p>Police said extensive searches had been carried out with no trace of the animals being found, suggesting they
        had been stolen.</p>

      <p>The sheep have been described as a mix of Mules, Texel, Beltex crosses, black-faced and Oxford crosses.</p>

      <p>They were marked with green spray between their shoulders, along with either blue, green, red or purple marks
        on their backs.</p>

      <p>Constable Rick Henderson, of Stornoway Police Station, said: “Due to the number of sheep missing, it is
        possible that a vehicle, such as a trailer, was used to remove them from the area. “We’re keen to speak with
        anyone who witnessed the theft, or saw any suspicious activity in the area.

        "We’re also interested in speaking with anyone who believes they may have been offered the sale of these sheep
        recently.”</p>

      <p><b>The first detailed social feasibility study into a trial reintroduction of lynx to Scotland has found that
        opinions on the idea are divided.</b></p>

      <p>The wild cats were once native to Britain but were driven to extinction 500 to 1,000 years ago.
        The Lynx to Scotland project <strong>commissioned the research</strong> in the Cairngorms National Park and
        Argyll.
      </p>

      <p>The study identified some support for bringing back lynx but found opposition among rural residents and
        workers.
        The perceived benefits included ecotourism and lynx helping to control roe deer numbers in areas where they
        damage woodland, but there were concerns that lynx could prey on livestock.
        According to the researchers, there was very little concern that the cats posed any danger to people.
        But they also said there was general agreement the wider public did not know enough about lynx to make informed
        decisions on whether they should return.
      </p>

      <p><b>Into the wild: Could lynx return to Scotland?</b></p>
      <p>Lynx to Scotland said the study showed a successful reintroduction was dependent on people's attitudes, and it
        believed a trial could still be possible in the future.
        Peter Cairns of Scotland: The Big Picture, one of the charities involved in the project, said: "When it comes to
        the return of the lynx, we're in the realm of not yet - but not never.
        <q>Positively, this new research shows there is sufficient appetite amongst different stakeholders to develop a
          more comprehensive understanding of this little-known species and the potential for its return to
          Scotland.</q></p>
